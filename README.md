## [ðŸ”— Discord-Bot Dashboard](https://ryand939.github.io/discord-bot-dashboard/)
I have played around with React before but this is my first site that actually has some practical use. Basically the site just reads off of a [Google Firebase](https://firebase.google.com/) DB which [my discord bot](https://github.com/ryand939/discord-bot) writes to every 90 minutes. 

I thought this would be a decent idea for a site since my bot already has a command to show info about the bot. Lots of fun, definitely wanting to make more apps with React in the future, it's just hard to come up with ideas that are worth doing.

I'm NOT extremely knowledgeable with using React but I am proud of this site as one of my first legitimate React apps. Certainly there could be a million improvements someone could make, but this site was made for the sake of learning more than anything.
